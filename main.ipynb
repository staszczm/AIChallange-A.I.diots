      "I don't have information on setting up a React agent from scratch in the provided context. However, I can explain the general steps to create a new React project from scratch:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Before you can start working with React, you must have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a New React App**: Use the `create-react-app` command-line utility which is the officially recommended way to create new React applications. To create a new app, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   npx create-react-app my-react-app\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   Replace `my-react-app` with whatever you want to name your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Navigate to Your App Directory**: Once the installation is complete, navigate to your newly created app directory:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   cd my-react-app\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Start the Development Server**: Start the local development server to see your app:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   npm start\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This will open your default browser to `http://localhost:3000/` where you can see your new React app running.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Edit Your Application**: You can start editing your application by modifying files in the `src` folder. The entry point is usually `src/index.js`, and the main App component is in `src/App.js`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Install Additional Packages**: If you need to include additional packages or libraries, you can install them using npm. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   npm install axios\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Build Your App for Production**: When you are ready to deploy your application, you can create a production build by running:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   npm run build\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This will create a `build` directory with your compiled application.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Deployment**: Deploy your application to a hosting service of your choice. There are many options like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that the steps above are quite basic and meant for setting up a new React project. There are many other considerations when working with React, such as state management, routing, and API calls, that you might need to account for depending on the complexity of your application.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Models\n",
      "Models in Django are used to define the data structure. The models provided (`SiteConfig`, `AcademicSession`, `AcademicTerm`, `Subject`, `StudentClass`, `Student`, and `Invoice`) represent the various entities that are part of the educational management system.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `SiteConfig`: This model appears to store key-value pairs for site configuration settings.\n",
      "- `AcademicSession`: Represents an academic year or period.\n",
      "- `AcademicTerm`: Represents a term or semester within an `AcademicSession`.\n",
      "- `Subject`: Represents a subject or course taught in the school.\n",
      "- `StudentClass`: Represents the different classes or grades in the school.\n",
      "- `Student`: Not shown in the provided code, but it would typically represent the students.\n",
      "- `Invoice`: Not shown in the provided code, but likely represents billing information related to students.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Views\n",
      "Views handle the request-response cycle in a web application. The provided views are class-based views that handle different CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the models.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `IndexView`, `SiteConfigView`, `SessionListView`, `SessionCreateView`, `SessionUpdateView`, `SessionDeleteView`, `TermListView`, `TermCreateView`, `TermUpdateView`, `TermDeleteView`, `ClassListView`, `ClassCreateView`, `ClassUpdateView`, `ClassDeleteView`, `SubjectListView`: These views are for listing, creating, updating, and deleting instances of their respective models. They all require the user to be logged in (`LoginRequiredMixin`) and some of them use `SuccessMessageMixin` to display success messages upon completion of an action.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `StudentListView`, `StudentDetailView`, `StudentCreateView`: These views specifically handle listing individual students, viewing details for a particular student, and creating new student records. The `StudentDetailView` also includes payment information from the `Invoice` model related to the student.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Forms\n",
      "Forms in Django are used for input validation and rendering HTML forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `SiteConfigForm`, `AcademicSessionForm`, `AcademicTermForm`, `SubjectForm`, `StudentClassForm`, `CurrentSessionForm`: These are form classes related to their respective models, used to create or update instances of models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### URLs\n",
      "URL configurations (`urlpatterns`) map URLs to views. The provided URL patterns are used to define the routes for the application's different pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Templates\n",
      "The `TEMPLATES` setting defines the directories where Django will look for HTML template files.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Static and Media Files\n",
      "The settings also include configuration for static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) and media files (like document uploads).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Admin\n",
      "Although not specified in detail, Django's admin site is usually used to manage the models through a web interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Management Command (`main`)\n",
      "The `main` function is the entry point for Django's command-line utility used for administrative tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tests\n",
      "A placeholder for test cases (`TestCase`), which would be used to write automated tests for the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Settings\n",
      "Settings like `DATABASES`, `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`, `LANGUAGE_CODE`, `TIME_ZONE`, `STATIC_URL`, `MEDIA_URL`, and others configure the application's behavior, such as database connection, password validation rules, localization, and paths for static and media files.\n",
      "\n",
      "### WSGI\n",
      "The `WSGI_APPLICATION` setting points to the WSGI application used to serve the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these code segments represent a typical structure of a Django web application, with models defining the data, views handling the logic, forms handling data submission, and URLs mapping routes to views. The application's purpose is to manage various aspects of an educational institution, such as configuring site settings, managing academic sessions and terms, handling student information, and tracking financial transactions.\n",

      "The `models.py` file in the context of a Django-based educational management web application contains definitions for the database models which represent the various entities involved in the application. Based on the provided context, the models represent configurations, academic sessions, terms, subjects, classes, and students. Here's a breakdown of each model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `SiteConfig`: This model is designed to store site configuration settings with a `key` and `value` field. Each configuration setting is represented by a unique slug in the `key` field and its corresponding value in the `value` field.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. `AcademicSession`: This model represents an academic session (like 2020/2021). It has a `name` field, which must be unique, and a `current` boolean field to indicate whether this session is the current one. The `ordering` Meta class option orders records by descending session names.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. `AcademicTerm`: This model represents an academic term (like First Term, Second Term, etc.). It has a `name` field, which must be unique, and a `current` boolean field as well. The `ordering` Meta class option orders records by the term name.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. `Subject`: This model represents a subject taught in the school. It has a unique `name` field and uses the `ordering` Meta class option to order subjects alphabetically by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. `StudentClass`: This model represents the classes into which students are grouped (like Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.). It has a unique `name` field. The Meta class options define a verbose name, a plural verbose name, and order the records alphabetically by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. `Student`: This model represents the students. It includes fields for the student's status, registration number, name, gender, date of birth, class, date of admission, parent's mobile number, address, and other details. The `ordering` Meta class option orders students by surname, firstname, and other_name.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. `StudentBulkUpload`: This model is designed to handle bulk uploads of student data through CSV files. It includes a `date_uploaded` field that automatically sets the date and time of the upload, and a `csv_file` field to store the uploaded file.\n",

Since the provided context already includes models like `Student`, `AcademicSession`, `AcademicTerm`, and `Subject`, along with some views for listing these records, we can enhance the functionality by adding a feature to calculate and record students' grades for different subjects in each term.\n",
